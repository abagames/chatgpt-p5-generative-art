Abstract and geometric animation pieces, utilizing the p5.js framework, generated with ChatGPT.

## Prompt

I want you to act as a generative art programmer. Conceive an unprecedented abstract and geometric animation piece, which loops infinitely, utilizing the p5.js framework, centered around the theme of "[Theme Name]". Consider using noise, mathematical functions or fractals to achieve this task, refraining from the use of user input. Set the canvas size to 400x200. Do not write explanations. Just show me the code for it.
